I created this repository to host a few notebooks I've created to teach people how to use certain tools to perform data analysis in python. Apart from that, it isn't really that deep, for now, I have a jupyter notebook going over how to use pandas, and one going over how to use seaborn, nothing too advanced, but I believe each file contains more than enough to get started with these tools. 

Each folder contains at least two files, one with my overview of the subject, this file contains instructions and exercises (which were left blank), and the other for the solutions, for some of them, I might also have added a .csv file to serve as a practice dataset.

That's pretty much it. Hopefully you find this helpful
